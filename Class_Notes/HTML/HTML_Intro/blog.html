        alt="IceCream Cake Recipe"/>
        <p>I. Ingredients and Layers: An ice cream cake does not involve traditional cake layers.
             Instead, it is made of layers of ice cream and other goodies such as Oreo crunchies,
              Homemade chocolate fudge and Whipped cream. </p>
        <p>II. Assembly steps: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Layer the ice cream: Line a cake pan with parchment paper. 
                    Add a layer of one ice cream flavor, followed by the Oreo crunchies, then another ice cream flavor.
                </li>
                <li>Add the fudge: Spread homemade chocolate fudge over the top ice cream layer.</li>
                <li>Freeze: Freeze the cake until firm.
                </li>
                <li>Frost with whipped cream: Frost the cake with homemade whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Decorate: Finish with rainbow confetti sprinkles.</li>
